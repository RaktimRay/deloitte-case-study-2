1. make booking time = random.choice(current, current time + sleep time)
2. add random difference between booking, pickup and drop. Drop and pickup = 15 to 120 mins, booking and pickup =    2-10 mins
3. add cost depending on drop-pickup: linear relation, can add some randomize in price selection.


1. launch 1 EC2 in Mumbai region -> default VPC or create VPC & subnet (deloitte-case-study-2-group-3), amazon 	   linux type instance, free tier, t2.micro
2. install python, kinesis agent, aws-cli (check if present or not), pip freeze -> pip install    requirements.txt, copy your program to EC2 instance
3. create case study 2 folder -> day-1, day-2, etc. 
4. connect to instance with ssh or putty
5. connect to bucket with code, copy from S3 bucket
6. execute code


ssh -i <key-pair> <ec2 instance name>@<public ip address>
ssh -i "group-03.pem" ec2-user@13.232.241.175
sudo yum install -y aws -kinesis-agent
ssh -i "deloitte-case-study-2-group-3.pem" ec2-user@13.235.0.181
ssh -i "test_3.pem" ec2-user@13.233.173.238


copy from S3
aws cli S3 cp -> google this
go to IAM > create a Role > AWS service > EC2 > attach policy > S3 read only > name
now go back to EC2 instance > attach the role > action > security > attach IAM role


another way of copy from laptop to EC2:
scp -i <key-pair> <file> ec2-user<public-ip>:/ec2-user/
scp -i "group-03.pem" group_3_code.py ec2-user@13.232.241.175/home/ec2-user/


IAMs:
attach firehose write role to EC2
attach S3 write role to firehose


adding user to group linux
ls -l
r = read
w = write
x = execute
-rw- = read-write-_
Also permissions: -rw-rw-r-- = owner-group-others
use the correct user - aws-kinesis-agent-user SO change owner of data file to aws-kinesis-agent-user (add to same group as log file group): sudo usermod -aG ec2-user aws-kinesis-agent-user 
chmod a+x


Kinesis agent config:
accessKey, secretAccessKey after firehose.endpoint
flow: filepattern <path/*.<type>
initialPosition: <not required>
start kinesis agent:
sudo service aws-kinesis-agent status
sudo service aws-kinesis-agent start
sudo service aws-kinesis-agent stop
check for error:
cd /var/log/aws-kinesis-agent/
